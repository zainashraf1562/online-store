# üõí Online Store Application

## Description of the Project

The **Online Store Application** is a Java console-based project that simulates a simple shopping experience.  
It allows users to browse products, add or remove items from their shopping cart, and complete purchases using cash payments.  
After checkout, the system automatically generates a timestamped sales receipt and saves it inside a dedicated **Receipts** folder.

This project is designed for beginners and students learning **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **file handling in Java**, offering a hands-on introduction to fundamental programming concepts.
